op3n_downloader.py
===================
Just an easy script to download cybrary op3n articles 

Run

I have only used two non standard libraries, requests and bs4, that you can download by issuing:

pip install requests
pip install bs4

You can also run it in a [virtualized enviroment](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/)
